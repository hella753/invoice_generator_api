# Invoice Generator API
This is a Django Rest Framework project that provides an API for
generating invoices in PDF format. This automates the process of creating invoices and allows 
users to manage their invoice templates efficiently. Authenticated users can create, 
update and delete the payer companies. They can generate invoices with the purpose text, 
amount (VAT calculated automatically 18%), language, template design, currency and the payer company.
